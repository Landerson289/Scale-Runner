# Scale-Runner
Scale runner is my entry for the Game Off Game Jam on itch.io 2023. It is a game which takes the fast paced runner/platformer style of geometry dash and mixes it with the fun off playing music.

You play as the cursor on top of a musician's sheet music, bouncing from note to note trying to get them to play the correct note in their piece. Choose from a variety of songs, genres and scales.
